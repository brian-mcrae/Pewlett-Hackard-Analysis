# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp Module 7

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to understand how Pewlett-Hackard's
workforce will be affected as our employees transition into retirement.  

## Results
* 63 percent of the retiring workforce are in Senior Engineer or Senior Staff positions
* We should seek mentor candidates who specialize in those two roles to backfill effectively
* Fewer than 2000 candidates exist who are eligible for the mentorship program
* We should consider opening up the eligibility requirements in order to attract more employees to the mentorship program

## Summary
1. How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
  * 90,398 employees will be reach retirement age soon
2. Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
  * Yes, there are more than enough employees available to mentor the next generation of leaders.  The problem is the opposite - not enough
  candidates to fill the mentorship program. Consider expanding the program and loosening the eligibility requirements.
